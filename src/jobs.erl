%% @spec ask(Type) -> {ok, Opaque} | {error, Reason}
%% @doc Asks permission to run a job of Type. Returns when permission granted.
%%
%% The simplest way to have jobs regulated is to spawn a request per job.
%% The process should immediately call this function, and when granted
%% permission, execute the job, and then terminate.
%% If for some reason the process needs to remain, to execute more jobs,
%% it should explicitly call `jobs:done(Opaque)'.
%% This is not strictly needed when regulation is rate-based, but as the
%% regulation strategy may change over time, it is the prudent thing to do.
%% @end
%%
ask(Type) ->
    jobs_server:ask(Type).

%% @spec done(Opaque) -> ok
%% @doc Signals completion of an executed task.
%%
%% This is used when the current process wants to submit more jobs to load
%% regulation. It is mandatory when performing counter-based regulation
%% (unless the process terminates after completing the task). It has no
%% effect if the job type is purely rate-regulated.
%% @end
%%
done(Opaque) ->
    jobs_server:done(Opaque).

%% @spec run(Type, Function::function()) -> Result
%% @doc Executes Function() when permission has been granted by job regulator.
%%
%% This is equivalent to performing the following sequence:
%% <pre>
%% case jobs:ask(Type) of
%%    {ok, Opaque} ->
%%       try Function()
%%         after
%%           jobs:done(Opaque)
%%       end;

run(Queue, F) when is_function(F, 0); is_function(F, 1) ->
    jobs_server:run(Queue, F).

%% @spec enqueue(Queue, Item) -> ok | {error, Reason}
%% @doc Inserts `Item` into a passive queue.
%%
%% Note that this function only works on passive queues. An exception will be
%% raised if the queue doesn't exist, or isn't passive.
%%
%% Returns `ok' if `Item' was successfully entered into the queue,
%% `{error, Reason}' otherwise (e.g. if the queue is full).
%% @end
enqueue(Queue, Item) ->
    jobs_server:enqueue(Queue, Item).

%% @spec dequeue(Queue, N) -> [{JobID, Item}]
%% @doc Extracts up to `N' items from a passive queue
%%
%% Note that this function only works on passive queues. An exception will be
%% raised if the queue doesn't exist, or if it isn't passive.
%%
%% This function will block until at least one item can be extracted from the
%% queue (see {@link enqueue/2}). No more than `N' items will be extracted.
%%
%% The items returned are on the form `{JobID, Item}', where `JobID' is in
%% the form of a microsecond timestamp
%% (see {@link jobs_lib:timestamp_to_datetime/1}), and `Item' is whatever was
%% provided in {@link enqueue/2}.
%% @end

%% @spec job_info(Opaque) -> undefined | Info
%% @doc Retrieves job-specific information from the `Opaque' data object.
%%
%% The queue could choose to return specific information that is passed to a
%% granted job request. This could be used e.g. for load-balancing strategies.
%% @end

%% @spec add_queue(Name::any(), Options::[{Key,Value}]) -> ok
%% @doc Installs a new queue in the load regulator on the current node.
%%
%% Valid options are:
%%
%% * `{regulators, Rs}', where `Rs' is a list of rate- or counter-based
%% regulators. Valid regulators listed below. Default: [].
%%
%% * `{type, Type}' - type of queue. Valid types listed below. Default: `fifo'.
%%
%% * `{action, Action}' - automatic action to perform for each request.
%% Valid actions described below. Default: `undefined'.
%%
%% * `{check_interval, I}' - If specified (in ms), this overrides the interval
%% derived from any existing rate regulator. Note that regardless of how often
%% the queue is checked, enough jobs will be dispatched at each interval to
%% maintain the highest allowed rate possible, but the check interval may
%% thus affect how many jobs are dispatched at the same time. Normally, this
%% should not have to be specified.
%%
%% * `{max_time, T}', specifies how long (in ms) a job is allowed to wait
%% in the queue before it is automatically rejected.
%% If `undefined', no limit is imposed.
%%
%% * `{max_size, S}', indicates how many items can be queued before requests
%% are automatically rejected. Strictly speaking, size is whatever the queue
%% behavior reports as the size; in the default queue behavior, it is the
%% number of elements in the queue.
%%  If `undefined', no limit is imposed.
%%
%% * `{link, undefined | pid()}', links the queue to a process. The queue
%%   will automatically be removed if the process dies. Default is `undefined',
%%   which means that the queue will not be linked. An exception will be raised
%%   if the option value is anything other than `undefined' or a valid pid.
%%   Note that if the referenced pid is not alive at queue creation time, the
%%   queue will be removed directly afterwards. An info report will be issued
%%   when the queue is removed.
%%
%% * `{mod, M}', indicates which queue behavior to use. Default is `jobs_queue'.
%%
%% In addition, some 'abbreviated' options are supported:
%%
%% * `{standard_rate, R}' - equivalent to
%% `[{regulators,[{rate,[{limit,R}, {modifiers,[{cpu,10},{memory,10}]}]}]}]'
%%
%% * `{standard_counter, C}' - equivalent to
%% `[{regulators,[{counter,[{limit,C}, {modifiers,[{cpu,10},{memory,10}]}]}]}]'
%%
%% * `{producer, F}' - equivalent to `{type, {producer, F}}'
%%
%% * `passive' - equivalent to `{type, {passive, fifo}}'
%%
%% * `approve | reject' - equivalent to `{action, approve | reject}'
%%
%% <b>Regulators</b>
%%
%% * `{rate, Opts}' - rate regulator. Valid options are
%% <ol>
%%  <li>`{limit, Limit}' where `Limit' is the maximum rate (requests/sec)</li>
%% <li>`{modifiers, Mods}', control feedback-based regulation. See below.</li>
%% <li>`{name, Name}', optional. The default name for the regulator is
%% `{rate, QueueName, N}', where `N' is an index indicating which rate regulator
%% in the list is referred. Currently, at most one rate regulator is allowed,
%% so `N' will always be `1'.</li>
%% </ol>
%%
%% * `{counter, Opts}' - counter regulator. Valid options are
%% <ol>
%%  <li>`{limit, Limit}', where `Limit' is the number of concurrent jobs
%% allowed.</li>
%%  <li>`{increment, Incr}', increment per job. Default is `1'.</li>
%%  <li>`{modifiers, Mods}', control feedback-based regulation. See below.</li>
%% </ol>
%%
%% * `{named_counter, Name, Incr}', use an existing counter, incrementing it
%% with `Incr' for each job. `Name' can either refer to a named top-level
%% counter (see {@link add_counter/2}), or a queue-specific counter
%% (these are named `{counter,Qname,N}', where `N' is an index specifying
%% their relative position in the regulators list - e.g. first or second
%% counter).
%%
%% * `{group_rate, R}', refers to a top-level group rate `R'.
%% See {@link add_group_rate/2}.
%%
%% <b>Types</b>
%%
%% * `fifo | lifo' - these are the types supported by the default queue
%% behavior. While lifo may sound like an odd choice, it may have benefits
%% for stochastic traffic with time constraints: there is no point to
%% 'fairness', since requests cannot control their place in the queue, and
%% choosing the 'freshest' job may increase overall goodness critera.
%%
%% * `{producer, F}', the queue is not for incoming requests, but rather
%% generates jobs. Valid options for `F' are
%% (for details, see {@link jobs_prod_simpe}):
%% <ol>
%%  <li>A fun of arity 0, indicating a stateless producer</li>
%%  <li>A fun of arity 2, indicating a stateful producer</li>
%%  <li>`{M, F, A}', indicating a stateless producer</li>
%%  <li>`{Mod, Args}' indicating a stateful producer</li>
%% </ol>
%%
%% * `{action, approve | reject}', specifies an automatic response to every
%% request. This can be used to either block a queue (`reject') or set it as
%% a pass-through ('approve').
%%
%% <b>Modifiers</b>
%%
%% Jobs supports feedback-based modification of regulators.
%%
%% The sampler framework sends feedback messages of type
%% `[{Modifier, Local, Remote::[{node(), Level}]}]'.
%%
%% Each regulator can specify a list of modifier instructions:
%%
%% * `{Modifier, Local, Remote}' - `Modifier' can be any label used by the
%% samplers (see {@link jobs_sampler}). `Local' and `Remote' indicate
%% increments in percent by which to reduce the limit of the given regulator.
%% The `Local' increment is used for feedback info pertaining to the local
%% node, and the `Remote' increment is used for remote indicators. `Local'
%% is given as a percentage value (e.g. `10' for `10 %'). The `Remote'
%% increment is either `{avg, Percent}' or `{max, Percent}', indicating whether
%% to respond to the average load of other nodes or to the most loaded node.
%% The correction from `Local' and the correction from `Remote' are summed
%% before applying to the regulator limit.
%%
%% * `{Modifier, Local}' - same as above, but responding only to local
%% indications, ignoring the load on remote nodes.
%%
%% * `{Modifier, F::function((Local, Remote) -> integer())}' - the function
%% `F(Local, Remote)' is applied and expected to return a correction value,
%% in percentage units.
%%
%% * `{Modifier, {Module, Function}}' - `Module:Function(Local Remote)'
%% is applied an expected to return a correction value in percentage units.
%%
%% For example, if a rate regulator has a limit of `100' and has a modifier,
%% `{cpu, 10}', then a feedback message of `{cpu, 2, _Remote}' will reduce
%% the rate limit by `2*10' percent, i.e. down to `80'.
%%
%% Note that modifiers are always applied to the <em>preset</em> limit,
%% not the current limit. Thus, the next round of feedback messages in our
%% example will be applied to the preset limit of `100', not the `80' that
%% resulted from the previous feedback messages. A correction value of `0'
%% will reset the limit to the preset value.
%%
%% If there are more than one modifier with the same name, the last one in the
%% list will be the one used.
